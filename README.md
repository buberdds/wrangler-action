# Wrangler action with publish URL 

This action extends core [Wrangler GitHub Action](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-action) by adding publish URL to `GITHUB_OUTPUT`

## Usage
- add id to your Wrangler deploy task
- grab publish URL via `steps.<YOUR_GH_TASK_ID>.outputs.url`

### Example action with multiple deploys and comment

    branches: [master]
